to run:
python3 ReplaceEdXStaff.py filename.csv

The csv file must have these headers/columns:
Course - course name or identifier (optional)
URL - the address of class' Course Team Settings page
Add - the e-mail addresses of the staff to be added. (not usernames)
      If there are multiple staff, space-separate them.
Promote - promote these people to Admin status
Remove - just like "Add"
Demote - removes Admin status

The output is another CSV file that shows which courses couldn't be accessed
and which people couldn't be removed. If the --list option is used,
the CSV instead shows who's admin and staff in all courses.

Options:
  -h or --help:    Print this message and exit.
  -l or --list:    List all staff and admin in all courses. Make no changes.
                   Only requires the URL column.
  -v or --visible: Run the browser in normal mode instead of headless.
